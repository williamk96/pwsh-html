# The Powershell HTML Project

Static pages are extremely tedious to write manually. But although there are many open tools to quickly generate these on-the-fly, there is a need to create these faster in closed, windows-only environments.

The vision of this project is to create a powershell framework for generating html files using parameters to declare attributes. There will be one function for every tag and templates as script files to generate html files based on a common style.

Tools like the python and batch scripts will be able to call on powershell to generate custom html files for email or liightweight web projects.
